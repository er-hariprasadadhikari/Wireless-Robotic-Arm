# Wirelessly Controlled Robotic Arm (Arduino)

This project demonstrates a **wirelessly controlled robotic arm** using two Arduino UNO boards and Bluetooth modules.  
The controller reads potentiometer values and sends joint angles wirelessly.  
The robotic arm receives these commands and drives servo motors accordingly.

## üöÄ Features
- Wireless control using Bluetooth (HC-05/HC-06)
- Real-time servo motor actuation
- EEPROM initialization for safe startup positions
- Modular and scalable design

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Required
- Arduino UNO √ó 2
- Bluetooth Modules (HC-05/HC-06) √ó 2
- Servo Motors (per joint of the robotic arm)
- Potentiometers (one per joint on controller side)
- Power supply (regulated 5V for servos)
- Robotic arm frame/chassis

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Overview
1. **Controller Side (Transmitter)**
   - Reads potentiometer values
   - Maps them to servo-compatible angles
   - Sends angles wirelessly via Bluetooth

2. **Robotic Arm Side (Receiver)**
   - Receives angles over Bluetooth
   - Drives servo motors to match received positions

3. **EEPROM Initialization**
   - Ensures the robotic arm always boots into a safe starting position

## üìÇ Repository Structure
```
/code
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ARM_TRANSMITTER/   -> Controller side code
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ARM_RECEIVER/      -> Robotic arm side code
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ EEPROM_SETUP/      -> EEPROM initialization sketch
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
1. Upload `EEPROM_SETUP/rom_data_set.ino` to the robotic arm Arduino **once** to set safe default positions.
2. Upload `ARM_TRANSMITTER/ARM_TRANSMITTER.ino` to the controller Arduino.
3. Upload `ARM_RECEIVER/arm_final.ino` to the robotic arm Arduino.
4. Pair Bluetooth modules (make sure one is set as Master, the other as Slave).
5. Power the system and move the potentiometers ‚Äî the robotic arm should follow in real time.
